You are analyzing a Dify workflow where a node was removed. Your task is to infer what the user's original request might have been that led to creating this node.

## Workflow Context
App Name: {app_name}
Description: {app_description}

## Current Workflow (after node removal)
{workflow_summary}

## Removed Node Information
Type: {node_type}
Title: {node_title}

Key Configuration:
{key_config}

## Insertion Position
The node was inserted after: {after_node_id}

## Task
Based on the workflow context and the removed node's configuration, write a concise, natural user message (1-2 sentences) that would lead to generating this specific node.

The message should:
- Be casual and natural (like a real user request)
- Reflect the node's specific purpose based on its configuration
- Be action-oriented (what the user wants to accomplish)
- Be concise (1-2 sentences max)

Good examples:
- "Check if the email ends with a personal email domain (gmail.com, outlook.com, etc.)"
- "Help me extract an array[string] from the output"
- "Add the value of nextSearchTopic to the topics array, forming a list of search topics"

Return ONLY the user message text, nothing else. Do not include quotes or explanations.
